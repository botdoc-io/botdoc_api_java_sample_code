This package demonstrates how to create a Push with Botdoc-API


In order to run this sample, do the following first:
1 - Open the file BotdocApiSample/src/botdocapisample/BotdocConnector
2 - Replace the variable "apikey" with your own apikey (you can get your apikey in the developer dashboard)
3 - Replace the variable "account_email" with the email your account is registered
4 - You should update the email and phone numbers the messages should be sent. Starting at line 116 to line 130 we define our contacts. In this block you can update the contacts with your own information.
5 - Now just execute the BotdocApiSample.java file
